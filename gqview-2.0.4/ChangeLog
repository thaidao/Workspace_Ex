	* bar_info.c (bar_info_new): Divide available space so that 2/3 goes to
	keywords entry and remaining 1/3 to comment entry.

	* cache_maint.c: Only manage shared thumbnails when the option is
	enabled, since this is a time consuming task.

	when the shared thumb cache is in use. Removed clear cache button, as
	it is now in the maintenance window.

	* preferences.c, README: Update copyright year.

Thu Jan  6 23:22:05 2005  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* fullscreen.c, globals.c, gqview.h, preferences.c, rcfile.c: Add
	option to try to keep full screen window above other windows. Since
	this uses a GTK 2.4 function, it is disabled on GTK 2.2.
	* main.c: Issue warning when running with a GTK library with an older
	minor version than what GQview was compiled with.

Wed Jan  5 19:59:41 2005  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* cache_maint.c: Hook up new shared thumbnails to maintenance utils.
	* main.c: When it takes time to get a connection to a remote GQview
	because it is still starting up, print progress dots (.) to the
	console to indicate we are waiting, and not hung.
	* thumb_standard.[ch]: Move core of thumb cache path building to
	thumb_std_cache_path. Added thumb_std_maint_* utilities for moving
	or deleting thumbnails to match changes to the source image.

Wed Jan  5 03:51:19 2005  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* collect-io.c (collection_save_private): Use a temp file when saving
	a collection so that if an error occurs during write the original is
	not lost. The only disadvantage with temp files is group and user ids
	of the original are not guaranteed to be preserved by chown, oh well.
	* preferences.c: Remove silly EXPERIMENTAL text from description of
	shared thumbnails cache option.
	* ui_fileops.[ch] (copy_file_attributes): Add arguments to select
	which attributes we want to copy.

Tue Jan  4 22:49:19 2005  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* image-load.[ch], typedefs.h: Add image_load_set_requested_size which
	will allow images to loader faster if you know you only need at most
	width by height image. Since only the jpeg gdk-pixbuf loader supports
	it, this only effects jpegs.
	* thumb.c, thumb_standard.c: These changes are currently disabled, but
	it would set the requested size when loading thumbnails for a speed
	improvement on jpegs.

Tue Jan  4 20:39:47 2005  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* cache_maint.c: Implemented local thumbnail rendering option, and
	only enable it when the standard thumb cache is active.
	* filelist.c (path_list_filter): When filtering a dir list remove
	.thumbnails and .metadata.
	* preferences.c: Do not allow focus on progress entry in safe delete
	clear dialog.
	* thumb.[ch]: Add thumb_loader_set_cache to control cache options on a
	per loader basis instead of using the global setting.
	* thumb_standard.[ch]: Same as thumb.c above. Also moved code that was
	duplicated in three places into thumb_loader_std_next_source. Added
	retry flag to force a retry on images that are flagged as a failure.
	* typedefs.h (ThumbLoader): Changes for gqview thumb loader in thumb.c.

Tue Jan  4 01:33:01 2005  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* cache_main.c: Reset list to NULL before using in next path_list.

Mon Jan  3 23:22:36 2005  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* cache_maint.[ch]: Add maintenance window to select various thumbnail
	cache operations for removing old thumbnails, deleting thumbnails, and
	to create thumbnails for a folder. Creating thumbnails local option is
	not yet implemented. Also move clear cache confirm dialog here.
	* layout_util.c: Change thumbnails menu item name, and open the
	maintenance window instead of purge utility.
	* preferences.c: Move clear cache confirm dialog out of here.
	* thumb_standard.[ch]: Make local thumb caches use permissions of the
	source images. Local thumbnails should not store failures. Added a
	thumb validate utility for use by the new thumb cache manager.

Sat Jan  1 23:02:49 2005  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* Makefile.am (gqview_sources): Add thumb_standard.[ch].
	* collect-io.c: Use new thumb loader functions.
	* collect-table.c: Use doubles instead of floats in most places.
	* collect.c: Remove unnecessary include of thumb.h.
	* dupe.[ch]: Use double for rank values, and updates for new thumb
	functions.
	* globals.c: Change default thumb size to 96x72, add
	thumbnail_spec_standard to toggle use of new thumbnail cache.
	* gqview.h, main.c: Add extern for thumbnail_spec_standard and change
	use of float to double.
	* image-load.[ch]: Use doubles instead of floats for progress value.
	* image.[ch]: Use doubles everywhere in place of floats, hence zoom is
	now a double.
	* layout.[ch], layout_image.[ch]: More float to double changes.
	* preferences.c: Change selection of thumbnail sizes offered to user,
	and allow a custom item when the thumbnail size configured in the
	rc file does not match the predefined list. Added toggle for new
	shared thumbnail standard (option needs a better description?)
	* print.c: Update for image zoom now being a double.
	* rcfile.c: Save and restore thumbnail_spec_standard.
	* search.c: More float to double change madness, and update for new
	thumb functions.
	* similar.[ch]: More floats to doubles.
	* thumb.[ch]: Updated the thumb function API to something a bit more
	sane, but mostly to match that of thumb_standard.h. When the standard
	thumb loaders are enabled thumb_loader_new will now return a loader
	from thumb_loader_std_new - the function access to thumb loaders is the
	same but the structures are completely different - don't access the
	structure directly. Also removed unused utility functions in thumbs.c.
	* thumb_standard.[ch]: New utilities for a thumb loader that implements
	the proposed thumbnail management standard on freedesktop.org.
	* typedefs.h: ThumbLoader is now treated as an opaque structure (but
	no attempt is made to hide it) because there are now two thumb loader
	implementations (thumb.c and thumb_standard.c). We check which loader
	and structure is in use with the standard_loader flag common to each. 
	* view_file_icon.[ch], view_file_list.[ch]: Change floats to doubles
	and updates for new thumb functions.

Fri Dec 31 02:30:28 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* main.c (help_browser_command): Only print info when debug is on.
	* collect-io.[ch]: Reduce collection manager timer to 10 seconds, and
	offset this by setting the idle function to low priority.

Thu Dec 30 22:30:19 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* layout.c (layout_status_update_progress): Fix progressbar height from
	changing status bar size by setting text to a space instead of NULL.

Thu Dec 30 16:51:40 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* bar_exif.c, bar_info.c, collect-table.c, dupe.c, layout_config.c,
	preferences.c, search.c, utilops.c, view_dir_list.c, view_dir_tree.c,
	view_file_icon.c, view_file_list.c: Specifically enable or disable
	the search feature of the GTkTreeViews, as it interferes with shortcuts
	for the main window and elsewhere, also when it is enabled set the
	search column.

	Fooey: GTK+ 2.6/4 may be binary compatible with 2.2, but the behavior
	of the treeview search feature has changed such that it can now get
	in the way when it is not specifically disabled.

Thu Dec 30 00:17:31 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* collect-io.c: Keep a pointer to the tail of the pending action list
	so that each append does not require walking the list.

Wed Dec 29 23:08:01 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* collect-io.[ch]: Add collection manager to update collections
	contained in $HOME/.gqview/collections when files are moved. Made
	collection loading abort after too many errors.
	* collect.[ch]: Add collection_add_check to allow adding files to a
	collection that do not exist, attach collection manager to maintenance
	move functions.
	* main.c (gqview_exit_final): Flush pending collection manager changes
	before exit.

Mon Dec 27 16:50:50 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* doc/5_1_search.html, 5_2_finding_duplicates.html, 6_collections.html:
	Add print context menu item to relevant sections of manual.
	* README: Updates.
	* configure.in: Release 1.5.5

Mon Dec 27 15:38:56 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* collect-table.c: Make context menu have same number of items, making
	the ones that do not apply insensitive. Add print menu item.
	* collect.[ch] (collection_list_get_path_list): Add utility to get a
	path list from a colletion list.
	* dupe.c, search.c: Add print to context menus.

Sun Dec 26 19:53:13 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* bar_info.c: Allow sizing of keyword sidebar when insensitive.
	* bar_sort.c, collect.c, preferences.c: Use gtk_window_present to
	raise windows instead of direct gdk_window_raise.
	* image.c: Fix broken redraws when sizing image view with NULL image,
	and fix clamping of scroller overlay within the new window size.
	* main.c: Raise remote main window when --remote is the only command
	line option. Fix crash when quitting from a remote --quit command.
	* remote.c (remote_server_client_cb): No need to check for error when
	return from g_io_channel_read_line is G_IO_STATUS_NORMAL.

Fri Dec 24 15:03:12 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* main.c: Add -sr<folder> remote command for recursive slideshows,
	based on patch submitted by Henry Minsky.
	* po/fr.po: Update French translation,
	submitted by Éric Lassauge <lassauge@users.sourceforge.net>.
	* po/it.po: Update Italian translation,
	submitted by Kostantino <inverness1ATvirgilio.it>.
	* po/sv.po: Update Swedish translation,
	submitted by Hans Ofverbeck <hans.ofverbeck@home.se>.
	* doc/11_1_command_line.html: Document new remote -sr command.

Fri Dec 24 01:47:04 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* image-load.c: Properly initialize load_fd to -1 in image_loader_new
	so that an immediate call to image_loader_free does not do bad things.
	Protect against calling image_loader_start more than once on a loader.

Wed Dec 22 22:44:57 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* bar_exif.c, bar_info.c, bar_sort.c: Make sidebar titles bold.
	* print.c: Retain print settings used in print dialog.
	* ui_misc.[ch]: Add pref_list_*_get/set() utilites for saving int,
	double, or string values in the history for future use.

Wed Dec 22 16:44:38 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* main.c: Change remote quit description to quit (from exit).
	* doc/10_1_general.html, 10_2_image.html, 10_3_window.html,
	10_6_advanced.html, 10_7_hidden.html, 11_1_command_line.html,
	11_2_keyboard_shortcuts.html, 2_2_menus.html, 2_6_image_pane.html,
	4_1_copy_move.html, 8_2_fullscreen.html, 9_printing.html: Update
	documentation for recent dialog and preference window changes, and
	do any doc updates pending in TODO.

Wed Dec 22 03:26:53 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* fullscreen.c, layout_config.c, preferences.c: Update preferences

	to different tabs, and removed the dithering option from the ui.
	* ui_misc.[ch]: New convenience functions for preference window.

	rand == RAND_MAX.

Tue Dec 14 10:23:49 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* bar_info.c, bar_sort.c, cache_maint.c, collect-dlg.c, collect.c,
	dupe.c, editors.c, main.c, preferences.c, search.c, ui_bookmark.c,
	ui_fileops.c, ui_pathsel.c, ui_tabcomp.c, view_dir_list.c,
	view_dir_tree.c, view_file_list.c: Updates and fixes for dialog
	utility changes and additions, use padding defines for widget spacing.
	* print.c: Move pref_* stuff out of here.
	* ui_misc.[ch]: Move pref_* stuff here.
	* ui_utildlg.[ch]: Added generic_dialog_add_message(), removed message
	arg from generic_dialog_new(), cleaned up button utilities into a
	single general purpose utility. Change widget spacing, dialog layout,
	and dialog button order to match GNOME HIG 2.0 (ie backwards).
	* utilops.[ch]: Changes for above utility dialog alterations.

Mon Dec  6 22:08:18 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* print.c: More updates for HIG utils, added image scale to reduce
	image size on page.
	* ui_misc.c: Fix incorrect namespace used for callback.

Fri Dec  3 21:41:08 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* main.c: Make -l command line option now include collections that are
	specified on the command line, also link the first collection on the
	command line to the main window so that -s and -f with a collection
	will work as expected.
	* print.c: Change margin to margins.

Wed Dec  1 19:59:46 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* print.c: Play with widget spacing and group styling to match HIG,
	get it and utils right here for when we use them to update rest of app.

Tue Nov 30 22:19:28 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* print.c: Implement postscript text placement, still needs to convert

Tue Nov 30 17:50:09 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* pixbuf_util.c(pixbuf_draw_layout): Clip layout to pixbuf before draw.

	grid when selecting proof sheet layout.

Wed Nov 17 19:08:11 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* image.c: Assume any request to resize the top window (per fit window
	to image option) will fail, and request a direct redraw - this works
	because we also changed the idle redraw handler's priority from
	G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE to GDK_PRIORITY_REDRAW so that it now has a lower
	priority than the resize signal. This fixes the fvwm2 maximized window
	does not redraw bug - the fault never was with fvwm2, although it would
	be nice if it set the maximized flag when windows are maximized :/.

Tue Nov 16 03:44:30 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* image.c, typedefs.h: Remove GtkEventbox used for image displays, as
	it is not necessary with GtkDrawingArea. Also removed GTK double
	buffering of the image display, fixes flicker when resizing window -
	double buffer is useless to us anyway since GQview's images are not
	displayed/drawn synchonously with GTK expose events.
	* img-view.c: Fix use of removed image eventbox.

Tue Nov  9 17:32:23 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* layout.c: Removed tooltip form the path entry.

	menus, F10 will also work for the collection, dupes, and image windows.

	with the spacebar (no selection done is sent in this case).
	* ui_menu.[ch](popup_position_clamp): Given a GtkMenu, ensure the
	passed coordinates will position the menu so that it is entirely on

	* view_file_icon.c: Do not pop up the filename tooltip if the window
	does not have the focus (fixes popping up when in fullscreen).
	* layout_image.c: The window and tools window should always be

	therefore still be able to use the main/tools window.

Tue Sep 24 16:14:22 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c, img-view.c, layout_image.c, layout_util.c: Fixed window
	title to remove the " - " part when no image is viewed. Also made the
	exit using control-Q consitent, hooked up control-P for image
	properties, and fixed it to drop out of full screen when showing the
	image properties window. (note that fullscreen is not intended for
	'file management' use, therefore new windows will not work correctly
	when displayed from fullscreen, so the mode is exited.)
	* collect.c, dups.c: Hooked up Control-P to properties.
	* README: Documented Ctrl-P properties window shortcut.

Tue Sep 24 14:20:15 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

Sat Sep 21 08:02:22 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* view_file_icon.c(vficon_maint_removed): If the removed file is the 1
	actively being thumbnailed, set the thumbnail pointer to NULL so that
	the thumb routines will ignore this cycle (instead of trying to use it
	along with the freed memory!).
	* view_file_list.c(vflist_maint_removed): Ditto.

Wed Jul  3 08:08:41 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Changes for upgrade to gettext 0.11.1
	* autogen.sh: More gettextize command line options.

	complaint lines removed from ChangeLog that could have been simply
	avoided by adding upgrade notes to the gettext README!
	* po/*.po: Make distcheck with new gettext did this, plus a few fixes
	that the new gettext complains about (and fails on).

	classic behavior of changing the path not effecting the displayed
	image. The new behavior is now to view the first image in the new
	path (many users wanted this - to enable old behavior set
	lazy_image_sync to true in gqviewrc).
	* main.c(main): Fixes to work with new non lazy image changing.

Sun Jun  9 20:26:47 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* layout_image.c: Set the main window (and tools) insensitive when

	display the subdirectories.

Sun Jun  9 19:30:07 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	for the main window. Also fixed pane positioning bug causing panes to
	move to 1,1 when user holds down h or f to hide or float the tools.

Wed Jun  5 19:38:40 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in: Added test for Xinerama.
	* fullscreen.c: Added Xinerama support based on patch from
	"Jörg Mensmann" <joerg.mensmann@gmx.de>
	(untested - do not have Xinerama display - NVidia's twinview does not
	support it with tv out as the second device - crash :/ )
	* Makefile.am(LD_ADD): Added Xinerama lib var.
	* view_file_list.c: Some crash fixes when refreshing the file view. Of
	note make sure nothing is selected until the clist is completely
	synced, and guard against vflist_index_get_data returning NULL,
	although that should no longer happen during the refresh.

Fri May 24 18:39:03 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* layout.c(layout_style_set): NULL widget pointers before destroying
	them, as the group box destruction will cause attempts to update

	* info.c: Added drag and drop support to info window (as source only).

	* layout_util.[ch]: Added new window menu item to create another main
	window, along with the companion close window menu item.
	* README: Updates.

Wed May  1 19:18:04 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dnd.[ch]: Removed image specific dnd functions (moved to img-view.c,
	as that is the only place that used them).
	* img-view.c: Dropping a list a of files onto the window now remembers
	the entire list, they can be navigated as in the main window and used
	to start a slideshow for that window. Dropped directories also pop up
	a menu requesting the actions, similar to the duplicates and
	collection window drag and drop stuff.
	* img-view.h: Added view_window_new_from_list.

Wed May  1 16:45:22 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c(image_zoom_adjust_real): Removed the rounding hack when
	incrementing the zoom from the 'fit to window' (zoom == 0.0) state. It
	was a broken attempt to clamp the zoom to the increment size, which,
	upon further review is really just unexpected behavior and breaks
	when the increment size is larger than the resulting fit window scale.
	(surprised no one saw this earlier, it has been this way since pre 1.0)
	* preferences.c(zoom_increment_cb): Fix for converting float to int.

Mon Apr 29 22:04:56 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* layout_image.c(layout_image_maint_removed): Move to the next closest
	image within a collection when deleting files, and a collection member
	is the actively viewed image.
	* view_file_icon.c, view_file_list.c: In the maintenance removed utils
	consider that the viewed image may be a collection member.

Mon Apr 29 16:18:13 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* main.c: Added support of %f escape to insert filenames anywhere
	within the editor command line.
	* rcfile.c(save_options): Remove brain dead fprintf that could result
	in writing random memory to the config file by simply specifying an
	printf format escape in an editor slot (oops).

Mon Apr 29 15:12:02 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* [GTK2 port]

	size.
	* main.c: gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file now has a gerror parameter, and the
	gtk_item_factory_dump_rc plus friends seem to be gone, so disabled it.
	* preferences.c: Fixes button box spacing and about label justify.
	* ui_help.c, ui_tabcomp.c, ui_utildlg.c: Fixes needed copied from the
	slik GTK2 port.
	* view_dir_list.c: Fixes for pulling the GdkFont from a style.
	* view_file_icon.c: Fixes for gtk_widget_popup removal and to return
	values so that drag and drop works.
	* view_file_list.c: Fixes for pulling the GdkFont from a style.
	* configure.in: Use new gtk2 checks.
	* src/Makefile.am: Removed gdk-pixbuf flags as it is now part of gtk2.

Fri Apr 26 00:30:02 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	view_file_icon.c, view_file_list.c: Proper signal handler casts, and

	Also added image_zoom_adjust_at_point(), which will keep the same
	point x,y in position after the zoom.
	* img-view.c, layout_image.c: Use the nre image_zoom_adjust_at_point
	so that ctrl-mouse wheel zooming stays relative to the mouse position.

Sun Apr 21 01:16:53 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* layout.c, typedefs.h: The active path of the main window is now
	checked for a timestamp change, is so call a refresh.

	a refresh or toggling thumbnails.

Wed Mar 14 08:50:00 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.[ch]: Added option to compare between two different sets of

	* gqview.h, image.c: Went back to 0.10.0 method of using
	gdk_pixbuf_composite_color() for every quality except NEAREST for
	images without transparency. Also disabled the TILES option for zooming

	gdk-pixbuf (0.10.0).  -- maybe I do have a bug floating around the
	scaling compuations somewhere, but damn if I can find it.

Thu Mar  8 10:14:32 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in, gqview.h, image.c: Made quick non-public package so

	* gqview.h, image.c, preferences.c, rcfile.c: Use the fixed simple
	scaling of gdk-pixbuf 0.10.0, also disabled the TILES zoom quality
	option until this is fixed in gdk-pixbuf (assuming it is a gdk-pixbuf
	bug, as the other qualities work fine - ask for test case of image
	sizes if anyone is interested in fixing this).

Wed Feb 28 16:40:02 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect-dlg.c, collect.c, dupe.c, img-view.c, preferences.c,
	utilops.c, window.c: Use GQview as the window class, as X man page
	encourages capitalization of first letter, and this removes conflict
	of gqview for instance of main window.

Mon Feb 26 15:39:15 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	pixbuf until the the loader is actually closed. (This should fix
	thumbnail generation failures for xpm and tiff).
	* similar.c (image_sim_fill_data): Fix to support generation of data
	for images with dimensions less than 32 x 32.

Thu Feb 22 08:44:38 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

        * ui_fileops.[ch]: Moved include of time.h back to the .c file.
        * ui_utildlg.c: #include <sys/types.h>, this should have been the
        original fix anyway...
	* gqview.h: Added #include <sys/types.h>
	* image-load.c: Removed above include.

Mon Feb 19 17:26:23 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	longer conflicts with pressing enter while focused on, say a button).

Sun Feb 18 06:52:51 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c (image_draw_focus): Fixed the focus drawing to follow themes,
	since painting merely a black rectangle was very broken with some
	theme engines (and did not follow the theme).

Tue Feb 13 02:34:33 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* ui_fileops.[ch]: Fix #include of time.h (moved it to header).

Mon Feb 12 15:04:51 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* README, TODO: Updates.
	* configure.in: Release 0.9.5.

Mon Feb 12 05:39:30 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* Makefile.am, gqview.spec.in: Added man page.
	* gqview.1: The man page, submitted by
	Ryan Murray <rmurray@debian.org>
	* README: Credits for man page.

Fri Feb  9 20:26:46 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* menu.c: Use gdk-pixbuf to generate toolbar images.
	* window.c (tollwindow_hide): Retrieve the window's geometry attributes
	before hiding the window (else we get a random X BadMatch error).

Fri Feb  9 19:45:26 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* fullscreen.c: The mouse is now hidden on start of fullscreen instead
	of waiting for the 'no-move timeout'.
	* dnd.c, filelist.[ch], menu.[ch], window.c: All pop-up menus are now
	created as needed, instead of globally at start-up. Right clicking
	unselected files in the file list now highlights them. Added a right
	click menu to the dir list that includes new slideshow recursive
	feature (also standard slideshow, and find duplicates choices).
	* globals.c, gqview.h: Removed unused global menu vars (above).
	* img-main.[ch]: Added main_image_slideshow_start_from_list().

Fri Feb  9 17:02:07 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c (image_size_top_window): When checking if a resize is needed,
	compare to the window that will actually be resized (the top window).
	This was checking the wrong widget's window, and was returning TRUE
	incorrectly, subsequently causing no update if the image had the same
	size for the main window.
	* po/hu.po: Updated Hungarian translation from
	Mátyás Tibor <templar@tempi.scene.hu>

Thu Feb  8 18:16:18 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added hu (Hungarian).
	* po/hu.po: Added Hungarian translation from
	Mátyás Tibor <templar@tempi.scene.hu>
	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation from
	Eric Lassauge <ros_at1@muzillac.tls.mms.fr>

Thu Feb  8 17:46:00 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c (image_change_from_image): Copy all relevent data from
	source, now fullscreen toggle while loading an image works. This is
	really a move function, it moves most data from source to dest.
	Probably should add a copy function that copies pixbuf, or loads from
	scratch if still loading source.
	* img-main.c, img-view.c: Mouse wheel (b4, b5) now reverses the
	'mouse scrolls image' option when holding down shift, and also zooms
	when holding down control.
	* typedefs.h (ImageWindow): Removed crufty size_idle_id.

Thu Feb  8 16:31:57 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* filelist.c (file_is_moved): Fixed bug causing moved files not to
	removed from the file list.
	* image.c (image_scroll_real): Fix race condition between expose_event
	and scrolling so that redraws are always called on the correct region.
	(This was the cause of missing redraws when scrolling with the mouse).

Thu Feb  8 15:30:14 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* img-main.c: Connect 'b' and 'p' keys to the full screen as well.

Mon Feb  5 17:37:29 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* README, TODO: Updates.
	* configure.in: Release 0.9.4

Mon Feb  5 17:03:27 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.c: Added keyboard shortcuts for the duplicates window.
	* image.c (image_change_complete): Call the update function
	explicitely if sync if FALSE.

Mon Feb  5 14:06:07 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect-dlg.c, filelist.c, utilops.[ch]: Added wrappers around the
	new dialog routines to re-implement place dialogs under mouse option.
	* ui_utildlg.h: Fixed #defines for re-definition safety.

Fri Feb  2 15:36:17 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.[ch]: Optimized Loading of data when setuping up for a compare.
	Also speedups by using the image_sim_compare_fast() (below), and
	setting the buffer size of the image loader higher (8).
	* similar.[ch] (image_sim_compare_fast): New function that aborts when
	the return no longer has the possibility of reaching the minimim
	requested value. Significantly faster when used to search for images
	that are very close. (say, above .95).

Fri Feb  2 01:02:11 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* similar.[ch]: New files, provides functions for simple comparison
	of images by average area color content.
	* dupe.[ch]: Added similarity compare methods (normal, high, and low
	accuracy matches.) The cutoff for each is 90, 95, and 85 percent, resp.

Wed Jan 31 19:31:10 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Fixed typo in comparison of window sizes in top_window_size,
	also do not call gtk_widget_set_usize in that func, as gdk_window_size
	is enough (and avoids duplicate size events). Also only call a redraw
	if the top window was not resized, as the size event will do this for
	us.
	* img-view.c: Attached ctrl-w to close a view window.

Wed Jan 31 16:43:21 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dnd.c (get_uri_file_list): Handle file:/// as well, so that drops
	with this do not result in "///file" path names.
	* img-view.c, main.c: Added following key support: P to toggle pause
	of slideshows, B to be same as BackSpace, and 1 - 4 to set zoom level.
	Also marked debug printfs with if (debug), and and added --version
	command line option.

Tue Jan 30 20:05:36 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect.[ch]: Added maintenance funcs for renamed, moved  files, etc.
	* dupe.[ch]: Added maintenance funcs (as above), also added Remove to
	the pop-up menu, and fixed the alternating color swap (now that
	individual items can be removed, the colors need to be re-synced).
	* filelist.[ch]: Added file_is_moved(), and fixes to use the
	file_maint_*() stuff.
	* img-main.[ch] (main_image_get_collection): Added this accessor.
	* utilops.[ch]: Added file_maint_*() funcs, call these when files have
	been manipulated (rename, move, delete).

Tue Jan 30 16:04:42 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image-load.[ch]: Added ability to set the priority of the image
	loader, default is G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE (same as g_idle_add).
	* typedefs.h (ImageLoader): Added idle_priority (see above).
	* image.c: The drawing queue now uses an idle with priority
	G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE, so that redraws of the image will occur before
	anything else. (this way when scrolling a still-loading image, the
	scrolled area is updated faster)

Mon Jan 29 13:48:47 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect-io.[ch], collect.[ch]: Const ify some arguments.
	* configure.in: Release 0.9.3

Mon Jan 29 13:35:21 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect.c (collection_window_new): Only load the path if it is
	absolute (starts with a '/');
	* main.c: Added -l,--list option to open a collection window with the
	files from the command line.

Mon Jan 29 12:52:19 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* menu.c: Applied patch from Zbigniew Chyla <cyba@gnome.pl> to remove
	translation markers from item_factory accessors.
	* po/pl.po: Updated Polish translation from
	Zbigniew Chyla <cyba@gnome.pl>
	* po/es.po: Updated Spanish translation (missed for 0.9.2) from
	Rodrigo Sancho Senosiain <ruy_ikari@bigfoot.com>
	* po/ru.po: Updated Russian translation (missed for 0.9.2) from
	Michael Bravo <mbravo@tag-ltd.spb.ru>
	* po/sl.po: Added Slovene translation (missed for 0.9.2) from
	Matej Erman <matej.erman@guest.arnes.si>

Thu Jan 25 21:09:10 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* utilops.c: Put the name of the file in the entry of the rename
	dialog, and select the text.
	* image.c: #ifdef some debugging output.

Thu Jan 25 15:28:08 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image-load.c: We do not use gdk_pixbuf_loader's "area_prepared"
	signal, so make sure to retrieve the pixbuf before calling our loader's
	"area_updated" signal.
	* image.c: Added new_data status to debugging info.

Wed Jan 24 12:03:27 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect.c, dupe.c, img-view.c, window.c: Set the wmclass to all
	lowercase, and changes for new window_set_icon().
	* gqview.h, main.c (window_set_icon): Changed to use gdk_pixbuf.
	* preferences.c: Made about it's own window, and made the config window
	a little more compact.

Wed Jan 24 11:13:52 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* filelist.[ch] (path_list_filter): New function, applies filter
	options on a path list.
	* collect-table.c, dupe.c: Run path lists through the filter (above).

Wed Jan 24 00:11:15 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Use the collection's name field instead of pulling it from
	the end of the path field.
	* main.c: Multiple files on the command line are now added to a
	collection, this collection is then set to the main window viewer.

Tue Jan 23 23:08:45 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* thumb.c: Fix xvpics support: the done signal was never being sent for
	xvpics. Also made xvpics scale to the thumbnail size even when smaller.

Tue Jan 23 21:58:49 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image-load.[ch], typedefs.h: Added ability to set the size of the
	read buffer. The buffer is always 512 bytes (as before), what this
	does is set the number of time to read from the file on each idle call,
	in effect increasing the buffer size to 512 x size.
	* image.c: Fixed race condition where an image area may be ready to be
	queued before the pixbuf is set. Fixed the tile blank flag, it is now
	set correctly in all (?) cases. Set the image loader buffer size to 4,
	so that more of the image is decoded between render calls. Also removed
	unused crufty function argument for image_tile_expose.

Tue Jan 23 13:37:29 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Fix scrolling while partially obscured, and made the focus
	drawing code cleaner (removed gtk_signal_disconnect() junk).

Tue Jan 23 11:32:08 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* globals.c, gqview.h, img-main.c, img-view.c, main.c, preferences.c,
	rcfile.c: Made the delete key optional, since this is a dangerous key
	with delete confirmation disabled. Also do not come out of fullscreen
	when confirm delete is disabled. Based on patch submitted by
	Niku Toivola <niku.toivola@iki.fi>

Mon Jan 22 20:32:53 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Fix setting scale when zoom_to_fit_expands is false.
	* collect-dlg.c: Fix the missing cancel button in the overwrite confirm
	dialog for the save as dialog.
	(The good: Easy fixes. The bad: Stupid mistakes.
	 The ugly: Had not tested these before release.)

Mon Jan 22 12:09:43 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* README: Updates.
	* configure.in: Release 0.9.2.

Sat Jan 20 00:37:47 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

        * ui_tabcomp.c (tab_completion_append_to_history): Fix to keep the
        same path in the entry when calling this.

Fri Jan 19 22:51:56 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* *.[ch]: Changed the copyright in all the files to 2001.

Fri Jan 19 22:41:45 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gqview.spec.in: Upped gdk-pixbuf req. to 0.9.0
	* configure.in: Bump version to 0.9.2
	* utilops.c: Fix text in copy/move dialog for multiple files.

Thu Jan 18 19:45:22 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.c: When starting a compare set the status text to file count,
	gives user idea of how many files are being compared.
	* image.c: Compile clean-up.
	* po/*.po: Make distcheck touched these.

Thu Jan 18 19:22:40 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* filelist.c, window.c: Fix drop down history on main window to change
	to the selected path after the popup window is hidden.
	* image.c (image_pixbuf_sync): Clear the window when set to a NULL
	pixbuf.
	* utilops.c (generic_dialog_add_images): Implemented this function.

Thu Jan 18 17:25:39 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* filelist.c: Fix sticky thumbnails when changing to a dir with files
	that have similar file names as the previous dir. Fix refresh to
	reload thumbnails (it was stalling in the thumb_next checks).
	* menu.c: Call filelist_refresh() instead of the hack to refresh by
	changing to the same dir.
	* preferences.c: Use a button box for the ok, apply, cancel buttons.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Added new files, removed missing.

Thu Jan 18 16:38:19 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* ui_clist_edit.[ch], ui_fileops.[ch], ui_menu.[ch], ui_pathsel.[ch],
	ui_tabcomp.[ch], ui_tabcomp.xpm, ui_utildlg.[ch]: New convenience files
	from SLIK.
	* clist_edit.[ch], fileops.[ch], path.[ch], tabcomp.[ch], tabcomp.xpm,
	utildlg.[ch]: Removed (see above).
	* collect-dlg.[ch], collect-io.c, collect-table.c, collect.c, dnd.c,
	dupe.c, filelist.[ch], gqview.h, image.c, img-main.[ch], img-view.[ch],
	menu.[ch], preferences.c, rcfile.c, slideshow.c, thumb.c, typedefs.h,
	utilops.[ch], window.c: Use the new convenience functions, constify
	things where needed.
	* main.c: Moved the file path utils out of here (see above).

Wed Jan 17 15:06:47 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.[ch]: Added fit window to image support (back in).
	* fullscreen.c, img-view.c, window.c: Fixes for above (namespaces).
	* typedefs.c (ImagwWindow): Changed zoom_enable to top_window_sync.

Tue Jan 16 13:40:29 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Scrolling while decoding a scaled image no longer causes
	dropped (black) areas. Also added an tile blank flag so that tiles
	with no loaded data simply render a black rectangle for a speed
	improvement (this is currrently semi-broken as image_tile_sync() is
	currently always called to set the blank flag to FALSE :(.

Mon Jan 15 21:53:25 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* fullscreen.c: Made the full screen window have a black background
	once again.
	* img-main.c: Enabled keyboard grab on fullscreen window, and re-grab
	the keyboard after a popup menu closes.

Sun Jan 14 17:39:47 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image-load.c(image_loader_free): Fix a memory leak.

Sun Jan 14 17:18:47 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.c: Create the clist with 6 columns (forgot to increment this
	when I added the thumbnail column).
	* image.[ch]: Added the update functions, made them work.
	* img-main.c, img-view.c: Set the update functions, attach the windows
	for the titles.
	* window.c: Set the initial image to the logo.

Sun Jan 14 15:26:49 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dnd.c: Temporarily disable dnd highlighting for image windows.
	* gqview.h, main.c: Minor fixups.
	* image.c: Generally works now, borders are cleared, focus is handled,
	etc. TODO: Add update callback, window title updating, and window
	auto-sizing.
	* menu.c: Added missing menu item 'Zoom to fit'. (must have been missed
	during convertion to a menu_factory.
	* window.c: Moved focus draw/handling code out of here (into image.c).

Sat Jan 13 18:51:20 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Trying to fix scale bugs/crashes in gdk_pixbuf_scale(), here
	is what I determined with gdk-pixbuf 0.9.2 (CVS, as of now):
	
	This only applies when the scale width offset is not zero _and_ the
	resulting right edge of the scaled image is also the right side of the
	source image. (in other words: when rendering a tile that is aligned
	with the right side of the image).

	Under the above conditions, gdk_pixbuf_scale() breaks for all
	GdkInterpTypes except NEAREST. gdk_pixbuf_compsite_color() is only
	broken for TILES (I suspect this is because eog uses it, but does not
	have a TILES option, so that was not tested). At this point I was tired
	of dealing with this mess, so I _think_ gdk_pixbuf_composite() is
	broken the same as gdk_pixbuf_scale() [memory is getting mushy]. Oh,
	and breakage means the last 2 columns of pixels are seamingly generated
	from some random memory point, at best causing them to be corrupted, at
	worst causing a crash.

	So what I did: Use gdk_pixbuf_composite_color() since it is the least
	broken. It does seem slower than gdk_pixbuf_scale(), since it does
	more.

	(I hope the gdk-pixbuf included with GTK+ 2.0 has this fixed, as the
	gdk-pixbuf in CVS seems to have little maintenance lately - 2 ChangeLog
	entries in 3 months...)

Fri Jan 12 12:07:44 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c, typedefs.h: Well, it now displays the image in all zoom
	settings. Still have to add (back) scrolling, set up the update call
	function, and work on redrawing the borders (borders currently do not
	get cleared to remove the previous image).

Thu Jan 11 13:35:15 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.[ch], typedefs.h: Start towards a new method of rendering the
	image to the screen. The image window is now basically _only_ a
	gtk_drawing_area, and we do all the scrolling ourselves. Currently I
	am lucky if it doesn't crash, and really lucky if part of an image
	appears :) Well, at least the namespaces for the functions are at
	least a little saner now, so I accomplished something, althought the
	whole thing still needs to be re-thought from the tile/render point
	of view.
	* dnd.c, fullscreen.c, img-main.c, img-view.c, main.c, slideshow.c,
	utildlg.c, window.c: Made it at least compile for testing.

Mon Jan  8 22:57:05 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.c (dupe_menu_view): Use filelist_change_to_full_path() in place
	of main_image_change_to(), so that the file list of the main window
	also syncs to the image.

Mon Jan  8 21:55:54 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.[ch]: Added thumbnail support.

Mon Jan  8 20:22:12 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.[ch]: More work, many fixes, added right click menu, and
	generally made it nice to use (useable).
	* collect-table.c: Add the collection to the dupe window.
	* menu.c: Added 'Find duplicates...' to the file menu.

Sat Dec 30 16:45:51 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* README, TODO: Updates.
	* collect-table.c: Set default duplicate window mask to sort by name.
	* dupe.[ch]: Allow change of comparison method by adding drop down
	menu, fixed dnd when dragging from the list.
	* filelist.c: Only allow rename when new name does not exist.
	

Thu Dec 14 20:20:14 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* globals.c, gqview.h, main.c: Set up menus to use GtkItemFactory and
	allow saving of user's accel keys (to ~/.gqview/accels).
	* menu.c: Use GtkItemFactory, fix callbacks to (void) for those that
	do not use the data (because GtkItemFactory has a weird signal
	alignment (gpointer is first).

	Sorry translators, menus must be re-translated (and it does not look
	like fun with GtkItemFactoryEntry using menu paths)

Thu Nov 30 17:45:08 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in: Do more compatible checks for png ?
	* tabcomp.c: Sanity checks for adding NULL key/path to list.

Mon Nov 20 12:32:08 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Added render_types to better decrease unnecessary renders.
	* main.c, window.c: Save/Restore the window positions like in gimp,
	since that seems to work better.
	(And gimp programmers can't be wrong :)

Wed Nov  8 09:16:45 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.[ch]: Added new files containing 'find duplicates' window.
	* collect-table.c: Added 'find duplicates...' to pop-up menu.
	* fileops.[ch]: Added checksum_simple(), made some things const.
	* collect.[ch]: Added collection_info_valid().

	* po/*.po: Make distcheck did this.
	* configure.in, README: Release 0.9.1.

Fri Sep  8 17:34:37 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* thumb.[ch](maintain_thumbnail_dir): Added a clear argument for
	completely clearing the disk cache.
	* filelist.c, menu.c: Changes for above.
	* preferences.c: Added a 'Clear cache' button.
	* utildlg.c: Allow passing NULL pointer for the cancel callback in
	confirm_dialog_new() and confirm_dialog_add().

Fri Sep  8 16:58:20 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* icons/collect.xpmi: Added wm icon for collection windows.
	* collect.c: Use it.

Fri Sep  8 15:55:53 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* menu.[ch]: Unified the main window image and fullscreen pop-up menu,
	and made it consistent with the one for view window. Added 'slideshow
	pause'.
	* collect-table.c, filelist.c, globals.c, gqview.h: Uses new menus,
	4 less global Widget variables now, yay.
	* image.c: Reset scroll to 0,0 on new image.
	* img-main.[ch]: Used new menus, added necessary accessors for menus.
	* img-view.c: Added 'view in new window', and 'slideshow pause'.

Fri Sep  8 13:33:12 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* utildlg.[ch]: Added class parameter to set windowmanager class for
	dialogs. Also added option to set window under the mouse.
	* collect-dlg.c, filelist.c, utilops.c: Changed to add class
	assignments.
	* globals.c, gqview.h, preferences.c, rcfile.c: Added
	place_dialogs_under_mouse var.

Fri Sep  8 12:15:08 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* po/ru.po: Updated Russian translation,
	submitted by val <frob@df.ru>.
	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation,
	submitted by Jean-pierre PEDRON <jppedron@club-internet.fr>.
	* po/pl.po: Added Polish translation,
	submitted by Grzegorz Kowal <g_kowal@poczta.onet.pl>
	(yes, close to a release once I do this).

Fri Sep  8 11:51:52 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect.c, image.c: Removed #warning warnings :)
	* fullscreen.c: Make sure the window is set to 0,0.

  > Multiple file selection.
  > Drag and drop.
  > Better keyboard support.
  > xvpics thumbnail support (read only), optional.
  - Add command line options to force show and hide of tools.
  * Fix tab completion bug.
  * Fix gtk 1.2.0 related bugs.

0.5.1 (12-8-98)
  - Should compile now without editing the Makefile with any gtk through 1.1.5
  * Fix file highlight bug when user tab completes to currently displayed dir.
  * Fix for FreeBSD.

  > Add path entry window with tab completion.
  > Add tab completion to all areas where a path can be typed.
  > Add option to save window positions.

    for some keyboard layouts.

0.4.3  (10-09-98)
  * Fix bug when 'fit window to image' is on, tools float/hide, and the next
    image selected has the same dimensions, it would not display.
  * More fixes dealing with 'fit window to image'

0.4.2  (10-07-98)
  > Add 'fit window to image' option when tools float or hide.
  > Add copy and move dialogs.
  > Add option to hide the tools completely.
  > Save settings on exit option added, and option to restore tool state.

0.4.1  (9-11-98)
  > Scrollbars removed, now you can pan the image by pressing and dragging the
    mouse on the image. The arrow keys will pan too (use [Ctrl] to pan faster)
  > The file selection area and status line can be 'floated' into a separate
    window, this allows the image window to display more of the image.
  > The file delete confirmation dialog can now be disabled in the options
    window.
  > The beginnings of keyboard support ( see the keyboard chart, above )
  - Now if a thumbnail is older than it's parent image, the thumbnail is
    recreated, so that changed images have their thumbnail properly updated.
  - While loading thumbnails GQview is now responsive to commands, slowly, but
    it works. You can now load images, delete files, etc. while the thumbnails
    are being generated. The thumbnail generation can be interrupted too by
    simply turning them off.
  * The code that determines the user's HOME directory has been rewritten, now
    hopefully users of nis will be happy. If the directory is not found or
    cannot be determined, GQview exits semi-gracefully.

  > Thumbnail caching added ($HOME/.gqview_thmb).

  - Other small changes including source re-organization.
  - Added a pixmap file to use as an icon (gqview.xpm).

0.3.2  (5-7-98)
  * Fixed a bug which made the first editor slot useless from config dialog.

0.3.1  (5-4-98)
  - Changed filelist code to properly implement Glist.
  - Moved definitions of variables and #includes to better places.

0.3.0  (4-24-98)
  > New feature! Thumbnails displayed in the file list(us 't' to toggle).
  > Thumbnails size can be selected (General Options).
  > Rewrite (again) of the file list (to support adding/removing entries
    without re-reading the entire directory listing, [still need to convert
    the directory list, however]).

  - if a file format cannot be determined, a generic 'unknown image' picture
    is displayed.

    the current working directory. (or must be relative to it)
  - When moving to the next (or previous) image, the file list
    scrolls to include the current image's name.

0.1.0  (2-28-98)
  > Added menu bar.
  > Added keyboard shorcuts.
  > Configuration can be saved (to .gqviewrc in user's home dir)
  > Command line support. (specify startup directory or file to view)
  > Can set startup directory in options window (can be disabled)
  > Added custom filtering options to support more formats
     (Imlib supports almost anything your system can read using
      ImageMagick or Netpbm, if available).
  > File operations: create directory, rename file, delete file.
  > clicking mouse on image:
      button one: next image
      button two: previous image

    and is now readable (some code still needs organizing, but
    at least now the code can be followed).
  > Makefile rewritten, it may still need editing for some systems.
    The '-g' gcc option was removed for the released code, this makes
    the binary about 1/3 smaller (it removes some debugging facilities)
  - Fixed the transparency problem. This removes the garbage displayed
    where an image is transparent, unfortunately for now it is set to purple.

0.0.2  (2-14-98)
  > Rewrote directory and file list handling, the lists
    can now be of any length.
  > Lists are now sorted.
  > History list no longer expands out of control as the
    directory path gets longer, entries are truncated at
    32 characters and '/...' is prepended.
  > Added configuration window, including:
    - show or hide dot files
    - select default zoom mode for new image
    - disable file filtering
    - choose file types to filter
    - about tab for version and contact info

0.0.1  (2-10-98)
  > No history, first release!
