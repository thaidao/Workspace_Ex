<H1>4.1 Copy and Move</H1>
<P>To copy an file in GQview press Control + C, to move an file press
Control + M. These operations also appear under File in the main
menu, and in the context menu of all images and files.</P>
<P>The Copy and Move operations and dialogs behave the same in
GQview, with the only difference being the final result. The
remaining text of this page applies equally to the Copy and Move
operations, for the remainder of this page these will be referred to
as a Copy/Move operation.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Initiating a Copy/Move operation will display a dialog to select
the destination folder to Copy/Move the selected file, after the
destination folder is selected GQview will proceed to Copy/Move the
images to the destination. If an error occurs or a file exists with
the same name as one of the files being Copy/Moved, a dialog will
appear prompting how to handle the situation.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><U>The Copy/Move dialog</U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">This is the dialog that is displayed
when initiating a Copy/Move operation. The dialog contains a row of
buttons near the top, vertical list of bookmarks along the left side,
a vertical list of folders in the current path, a text entry field,
and a row of buttons along the bottom.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>Home button:</B> Activate this
button to change the active path to your home folder.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>New Folder button:</B> Activate
this to create a new empty folder as a sub folder of the active path.
The new folder will appear in the folder list ready for you to type
in the desired name.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>Show Hidden check box:</B> Enabling
this check box will cause hidden folders to appear in the folder
list.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>Bookmark list:</B> This list on the
left side of the window allows you to save links to folders that are
frequently used. Activating a bookmark will change the active path to
that pointed to by the link. To add items to the bookmark list
highlight a folder and press Control + B, select &ldquo;Add bookmark&rdquo;
from the folder's context menu, or drag a folder onto the bookmark
list.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">The bookmark has a context menu that
can be displayed by clicking the right mouse button, or pressing the
Menu key when a bookmark has the focus. From the context menu you can
edit a bookmark, move it up or down in the list, or remove the
bookmark from the list. A bookmark can also be moved by pressing
Shift + Up or Shift + Down while it has the focus.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>Folder list:</B> This is the list
that displays the folders contained in the active path. To change the
active path to a folder displayed in this list double click the
primary mouse button or highlight the folder with the keyboard and
press Enter or Space. This list has a context menu that allows
renaming or bookmarking the selected folder. A folder can also be
dragged onto the bookmark list to add a bookmark.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>Path entry:</B> This text entry
displays the active path of the dialog. The path can be directly
edited using this entry. Tab completion is supported, and the drop
down arrow will display a list of recently selected folders.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>Copy/Move button:</B> The name of
this button will differ depending on the selected operation,
activating it will start the operation with the folder displayed in
the path entry as the destination.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>Cancel button:</B> Activate this
button to close the dialog, the operation will be aborted.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><U>The error dialog</U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">If a problem occurs because GQview is
unable to Copy or Move a selected file a dialog will appear to notify
the user. The dialog will also ask if the operation should continue
if one or more files remain to be Copied or Moved.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><U>The overwrite dialog</U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">If a file with the same name exists in
the selected destination a dialog will appear to notify the user and
ask how to resolve the conflict. The dialog will also display the
source and destination images. The following possible solutions will
be offered:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>Auto rename:</B> Enabling this
check box to have GQview select a unique name for the destination
file, the proposed new name will appear in the rename entry field.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>Rename:</B> Enable this check box
to manually enter a new name for the file.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>Overwrite:</B> Activate this will
overwrite the existing file, or rename it if one of the rename check
boxes are enabled.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>Overwrite all:</B> Activating this
will perform the same operation as the Yes button, however any
further file name conflicts will be handled quietly in the same
method as is selected for the current file.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; font-weight: medium"><B>Skip:</B> This
button will skip doing anything to the file in question, and resume
the operation with the next file. The source file will remain
untouched.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; font-weight: medium"><B>Skip All:</B>
This will perform the same as the Skip button, however any further
file name conflicts will be quietly ignored for all remaining files.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; font-weight: medium"><B>Cancel:</B>
This will close the dialog and stop the operation, all remaining
files will be ignored.</P>
