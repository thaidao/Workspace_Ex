<H1>2.6 Image Pane</H1>
<P>The image pane is the region of the main window that displays the
selected image. The image pane allows adjustment of display size and
orientation; it also provides several methods to manipulate the image
with the mouse and keyboard.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><U>Image display</U></P>
<P>The image is drawn to the screen as it is decoded from disk. The
image can be panned and zoomed while it is still loading. Image
adjustment operations for rotation, mirror, and flip will delay until
the image is completed. The adjustment queue will remember one
operation and will retain the most recently requested function, which
will be performed once the image has finished loading.</P>
<P>The quality of the image, especially when using the zoom feature,
is dependent on the settings that are available on the <A HREF="10_2_image.html">Image
tab</A> of the preferences dialog.</P>
<P>To increase the speed of loading the next image when navigating
the image list in sequence, enable the <A HREF="10_2_image.html">Preload
next image</A> option.</P>
