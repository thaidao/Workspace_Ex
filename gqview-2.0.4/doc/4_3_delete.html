<H1>4.3 Delete</H1>
<P>To delete a file in GQview press Control + D, or select Delete
from the file menu. Delete is also available in the context menu of
all images and files. If <A HREF="10_6_advanced.html">Enable delete
key</A> is enabled in Options, pressing the Delete key can also be
used to delete files.</P>
<P>The behavior when starting a delete operation depends on the
<A HREF="10_6_advanced.html">Confirm file delete</A> option in
Options. If the option is enabled a dialog will appear to confirm the
operation, if it is not enabled the files will be deleted without
further interaction.  In all cases if the file is unable to be
deleted you will be notified by a dialog.</P>
<P><BR><BR>

<P><U>Confirm delete dialog</U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">The dialog that appears when delete
confirmation is enabled will show the file or files to be deleted. To
delete the file press Enter or activate the Delete button. Pressing
Escape or activating the Cancel button will close the dialog and
abort the operation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">When deleting multiple files, the
dialog will include two arrow buttons to step the image preview
through the list of files to be deleted. Initially the preview will
be blank, activate the right arrow to display the first file.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">The dialog will also display the
status of the <A HREF="10_6_advanced.html">Safe Delete</A> feature.
Use this to determine if a file to be Deleted will be immediately
lost, or if the file can possibly be recovered from the Safe Delete
folder.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">If a file is unable to be deleted, a
dialog will appear to notify you. If multiple files were selected and
any remain, the dialog will include a Continue button, activating
this button or pressing Enter will delete the remaining files.
Pressing Escape or activating the Cancel button will close the dialog
and the remaining files will not be deleted.</P>

<P><U>Safe Delete</U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">GQview includes a feature to
temporarily store deleted files in a selected folder, to use this
feature enable <A HREF="10_6_advanced.html">Safe Delete</A> on the
advanced tab of the preferences dialog. Safe Delete includes these
options:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.58in"><B>Folder:</B> The folder to use for
temporarily retaining deleted files.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.58in"><B>Maximum size:</B> The maximum
amount of disk space to use when storing deleted files, in megabytes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">When the total size of the deleted
files stored in the Safe Delete folder exceeds the Maximum size, the
oldest files are removed from the folder to make space for the new
deleted files. <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Files moved to the
Safe Delete folder are prefixed with a six digit number in the
format:</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.58in"><I>nnnnnn_FILENAME</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; font-style: normal">This is used to
distinguish which files to remove first when clearing space for new
files. The digit counter increments with each deleted file.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; font-style: normal">To clear the
contents of the Safe Delete folder, activate the Clear button
provided for this purpose on the <A HREF="10_6_advanced.html">Advanced
tab</A> in Options.</P>
